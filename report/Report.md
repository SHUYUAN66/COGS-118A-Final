## Conclusion and Future Work
    By using GridsearchCV, I got my best hyperparameters as well as 
    - For now, although I established functions enabling to do less hard code, they certainly could be approved by adding exceptions or include more cases. Once such functions could be used as a package, there will be keywords such as  "AUTO" "GridSearchCV - hyperparameter" "auto model selection".
    - In addition, the data preprocessing might need to be improved to consider every details in every data sets.
